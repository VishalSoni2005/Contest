# Tough Average Problems – Set 2 (Solutions)

Each question has a short *chant-style* hint and a clear step-by-step solution.

---

## Q1. (TCS NQT 2023)
**Chant (short):** Total up, include teacher, subtract — teacher's weight = new total − old total.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 50 × 55 = 2750.
New total = 51 × 56 = 2856.
Teacher = 2856 − 2750 = **106 kg**.

---

## Q2. (Infosys 2023)
**Chant (short):** Remove topper effect: topper = old total − new total.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 60 × 70 = 4200.
New total without topper = 59 × 69 = 4071.
Topper = 4200 − 4071 = **129 marks**.

---

## Q3. (Wipro 2022)
**Chant (short):** Excluded sum = old total − remaining total ⇒ highest + lowest = difference.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 40 × 45 = 1800.
Remaining total (excluding two innings) = 38 × 44 = 1672.
Sum of excluded two innings = 1800 − 1672 = 128.
Given lowest = 10, so highest = 128 − 10 = **118 runs**.

**Note:** The statement "highest score is 150" contradicts this calculation. Either the given 150 is incorrect or the averages provided are inconsistent. Based on the averages, computed highest = 118.

---

## Q4. (Accenture 2022)
**Chant (short):** New total − old total = 5th employee.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 4 × 25000 = 100000.
New total = 5 × 27000 = 135000.
Fifth employee = 135000 − 100000 = **₹35,000**.

---

## Q5. (Capgemini 2023)
**Chant (short):** Fix wrong entry: add difference to total, divide.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 30 × 55 = 1650.
Wrong entry was 45; correct is 75 → add 30.
Correct total = 1650 + 30 = 1680.
Correct average = 1680 / 30 = **56**.

---

## Q6. (Cognizant 2022)
**Chant (short):** Manager = new total (7×avg) − old total.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 6 × 18000 = 108000.
New total = 7 × 20000 = 140000.
Manager = 140000 − 108000 = **₹32,000**.

---

## Q7. (Deloitte 2023)
**Chant (short):** Correct total = old total + correction; average = corrected total ÷ n.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 30 × 40 = 1200.
Error: one recorded 25 instead of 45 → missing +20.
Correct total = 1200 + 20 = 1220.
Correct average = 1220 / 30 = **40 2/3 (≈40.6667)**.

---

## Q8. (TCS Digital 2023)
**Chant (short):** Subtract mistake difference from total then divide.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 50 × 60 = 3000.
Wrong entry 95 instead of 59 → overcount by 36.
Correct total = 3000 − 36 = 2964.
Correct average = 2964 / 50 = **59.28**.

---

## Q9. (Wipro Elite 2023)
**Chant (short):** If every number increases by k, avg increases by k.

**Detailed:**
Old avg = 40. Add 4 to every number → new avg = 40 + 4 = **44**.

---

## Q10. (Infosys 2022)
**Chant (short):** New total = old total − left + new; solve for left.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 10 × 50 = 500.
After replacement new total = 10 × 51 = 510.
Let left = x. Then 500 − x + 60 = 510 ⇒ x = 500 + 60 − 510 = **50 kg**.

---

## Q11. (Accenture 2023)
**Chant (short):** Replace the wrong mark, recompute total ÷ n.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 20 × 40 = 800.
One mark was 35 instead of 53 → correct total = 800 − 35 + 53 = 818.
New average = 818 / 20 = **40.9**.

---

## Q12. (Capgemini 2022)
**Chant (short):** Add manager salary to total, divide by 11.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 10 × 40000 = 400000.
With manager total = 400000 + 70000 = 470000.
New average = 470000 / 11 = **₹42,727.27 (approx.)**.

---

## Q13. (Cognizant 2023)
**Chant (short):** Removed = old total − new total (after removal).

**Detailed:**
Old total = 8 × 60 = 480.
New total = 7 × 58 = 406.
Removed number = 480 − 406 = **74**.

---

## Q14. (TCS NQT 2022)
**Chant (short):** Girls total = grand total − boys total; divide.

**Detailed:**
Grand total = 40 × 50 = 2000.
Boys total = 20 × 55 = 1100.
Girls total = 2000 − 1100 = 900.
Girls average = 900 / 20 = **45**.

---

## Q15. (Infosys 2023)
**Chant (short):** Removed marks = old total − new total (99×new avg).

**Detailed:**
Old total = 100 × 45 = 4500.
New total after removal = 99 × 44.9 = 4445.1.
Removed marks = 4500 − 4445.1 = **54.9**.

**Note:** In many test contexts marks are integers; rounding gives **55** (closest integer). The exact arithmetic yields 54.9.

---

## Q16. (Wipro 2022)
**Chant (short):** Manager = new total (31×21k) − old total.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 30 × 20000 = 600000.
New total = 31 × 21000 = 651000.
Manager = 651000 − 600000 = **₹51,000**.

---

## Q17. (Accenture 2023)
**Chant (short):** New person's age = new total − old total.

**Detailed:**
Old total = 5 × 20 = 100.
New total = 6 × 22 = 132.
New person's age = 132 − 100 = **32 years**.

---

## Q18. (Capgemini 2023)
**Chant (short):** Check totals — if inconsistent, point it out.

**Detailed:**
Given: 20 players avg 40 ⇒ total = 800.
Excluding highest 120, remaining 19 avg 37 ⇒ remaining total = 19 × 37 = 703.
But if we add back the highest: 703 + 120 = 823, which is not equal to the given total 800. This yields an impossible (negative) lowest score:
Lowest = 800 − (703 + 120) = −23 (impossible).

**Conclusion:** The data are inconsistent. Either the original average, the highest score, or the post-exclusion average is wrong. If the problem intended consistency, the original total must be 823, not 800. In that case the lowest score would be calculated from further data; as written, the question is contradictory.

---

## Q19. (TCS Digital 2022)
**Chant (short):** Correct total = old total − (wrong − correct).

**Detailed:**
Old total = 50 × 55 = 2750.
Wrong entry 85 instead of 58 → overcount by 27.
Correct total = 2750 − 27 = 2723.
Correct average = 2723 / 50 = **54.46**.

---

## Q20. (Mindtree 2022)
**Chant (short):** Teacher = new total − students total.

**Detailed:**
Students total = 15 × 20 = 300.
With teacher total = 16 × 21 = 336.
Teacher's age = 336 − 300 = **36 years**.
