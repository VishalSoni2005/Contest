## Solutions

### Solution 1:
Total weight of students = 30 × 60 = 1800.  
Including teacher = (31 × 61) = 1891.  
Teacher’s weight = 1891 – 1800 = **91 kg**.

---

### Solution 2:
Total marks = 50 × 45 = 2250.  
After excluding, total = 49 × 44 = 2156.  
Student’s marks = 2250 – 2156 = **94**.

---

### Solution 3:
Total age = 15 × 20 = 300.  
Including teacher = 335.  
New average = 335 ÷ 16 = **20.94 years**.

---

### Solution 4:
Total = 8 × 15000 = 120000.  
With manager = 9 × 17000 = 153000.  
Manager = 153000 – 120000 = **₹33,000**.

---

### Solution 5:
Wrong sum = 25 × 36 = 900.  
Correct sum = 900 – 16 + 56 = 940.  
Correct average = 940 ÷ 25 = **37.6**.

---

### Solution 6:
New average = 27 + 2 = **29°C**.

---

### Solution 7:
20 × 50 = 1000.  
Excluding 2 innings = 18 × 48 = 864.  
Sum of excluded = 1000 – 864 = 136.  
Lowest + Highest = 136.  
Highest – Lowest = 100.  
=> Highest = 118.  
**Answer: 118**.

---

### Solution 8:
Total age = 5 × 21 = 105.  
With baby = 105 ÷ 6 = **17.5 years**.

---

### Solution 9:
Wrong total = 40 × 50 = 2000.  
Correct total = 2000 – 65 + 85 = 2020.  
Correct average = 2020 ÷ 40 = **50.5**.

---

### Solution 10:
Total = 40 × 15 = 600.  
With teacher = 41 × 15.5 = 635.5.  
Teacher = 635.5 – 600 = **35.5 years**.

---

### Solution 11:
Total = 12 × 20000 = 240000.  
With manager = 13 × 21000 = 273000.  
Manager = 273000 – 240000 = **₹33,000**.

---

### Solution 12:
Wrong total = 30 × 60 = 1800.  
Correct total = 1800 – 80 + 50 = 1770.  
Correct average = 1770 ÷ 30 = **59**.
