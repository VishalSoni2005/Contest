## Solutions (Attempt the problems first; then check answers)

> **Note:** Units are shown clearly. Round intermediate values where helpful; final answers are rounded sensibly.

### Solution 1 — TCS 2019
Train length = 240 m. Speed = 54 km/hr = (54 * 5/18) = 15 m/s. Time to cross platform = 30 s. Distance covered in 30 s = 15 * 30 = 450 m. That distance = train length + platform length. So platform length = 450 - 240 = **210 m**.

### Solution 2 — Infosys 2020
Lengths sum = 125 + 175 = 300 m. Speeds: 54 km/hr = 15 m/s; 36 km/hr = 10 m/s. Approaching each other → relative speed = 15 + 10 = 25 m/s. Time = 300 / 25 = **12 seconds**.

### Solution 3 — Wipro 2018
Total distance = 90 + 120 + 60 = 270 km.
Times: t1 = 90/30 = 3 hr; t2 = 120/40 = 3 hr; t3 = 60/20 = 3 hr. Total time = 9 hr. Average speed = 270/9 = **30 km/hr**.

### Solution 4 — Accenture 2021
Downstream speed = 24/2 = 12 km/hr. Upstream speed = 24/3 = 8 km/hr.
Boat speed = (12 + 8)/2 = **10 km/hr**. Stream speed = (12 - 8)/2 = **2 km/hr**.

### Solution 5 — Deloitte 2019
Let second courier catch first after t hours from his own start. First courier had 1 hour head start, so first has been traveling for (t + 1) hours. Distances equal when caught: 36*(t+1) = 54*t → 36t + 36 = 54t → 18t = 36 → t = 2 hours. So **2 hours after the second starts**.

### Solution 6 — Cognizant 2020
A finishes 1000 m in 200 s → speed_A = 1000/200 = 5 m/s.
A gives B 50 m start, so when A runs 1000 m, B runs 950 m in same time 200 s. So B's speed = 950/200 = 4.75 m/s = (4.75 * 18/5) = 17.1 km/hr approx. Alternatively in m/s: **4.75 m/s** (≈17.1 km/hr).

### Solution 7 — Amazon 2017
They run towards each other (opposite directions) effectively. Combined speed = 5 + 3 = 8 m/s. Distance to meet first time = 400 m (starting same point but opposite directions, they meet at half-lap? Actually if start same point and go opposite, distance to first meeting is the circumference / combined speed? Think: they start same point at t=0 and go opposite; they meet when sum of distances = 400). Time = 400 / 8 = 50 s. So they meet after **50 seconds**.

### Solution 8 — Microsoft 2016
Let train length = L m, speed = v m/s.
Crossing pole: time = L/v = 20 → L = 20v.
Crossing platform: (L + 360)/v = 48 → substituting L: (20v + 360)/v = 48 → 20 + 360/v = 48 → 360/v = 28 → v = 360/28 = 90/7 ≈ 12.8571 m/s. Then L = 20v = 20 * 90/7 = 1800/7 ≈ 257.14 m. Speed in km/hr = v * 18/5 = (90/7)*(18/5) = (90*18)/(35*7?) Wait correct calculation: v = 90/7 m/s. km/hr = (90/7)*(18/5) = (90*18)/(35) = (1620)/35 = 46.2857 km/hr approx. So length ≈ **257.14 m**, speed ≈ **46.29 km/hr**.

### Solution 9 — Goldman Sachs 2018
Equal distances at speeds a=30, b=60. Average speed = harmonic mean = (2ab)/(a+b) = (2*30*60)/(90) = (3600)/90 = 40 km/hr. So **40 km/hr**.

### Solution 10 — JPMorgan 2019
Let distance = D, original speed = v.
Time going = D/v = 2 hours → D = 2v.
Return speed = 0.8v (20% drop). Time return = D/(0.8v) = 2v/(0.8v) = 2/0.8 = 2.5 hours. Return takes 0.5 hours more → consistent. So equations satisfied for any v? Check: it says return takes 30 minutes more. We found return takes 2.5 hours, which is indeed 0.5 hr more than 2 hr regardless of v. We need v numeric? But D = 2v is unspecified. The condition is always true for any v — but that's because proportion holds. They likely expect the original speed cannot be determined without distance. However if the problem intended a numeric value, it's underdetermined. We'll supply explanation: **Original speed cannot be uniquely determined**; constraint shows the drop of 20% leads to 30 min extra always when initial time is 2 hours. If forced, pick any v; but typical intended answer: original speed = any positive value (insufficient info). *Alternate interpretation:* maybe they meant distance fixed; but it's already implied. So answer: **Insufficient information — any positive speed satisfies the condition.**

### Solution 11 — Flipkart 2020
Downstream speed = 150/10 = 15 km/hr. Upstream speed = 150/15 = 10 km/hr.
Boat speed = (15 + 10)/2 = **12.5 km/hr**.
Current = (15 - 10)/2 = **2.5 km/hr**.

### Solution 12 — HCL 2019
Relative speed = 90 - 60 = 30 km/hr = (30 * 1000/3600) = 8.333... m/s.
Distance to clear = relative distance = 12 + 4 = 16 m. Time = 16 / (8.3333) = 1.92 s approx. So **≈1.92 seconds**.

### Solution 13 — Bosch 2018
Let speeds be x (first) and y (second) km/hr. They meet after 3 hours: x*3 + y*3 = 210 → 3(x + y) = 210 → x + y = 70. (1)
If first were (x - 6) and second (y + 4), meeting after 2.5 hr: 2.5(x - 6 + y + 4) = 210 → 2.5(x + y - 2) = 210 → x + y - 2 = 84 → x + y = 86. This contradicts (1). Wait re-check algebra.
Let's compute correctly: Distance = 210.
Case 1: time t1 = 3 → (x + y)*3 = 210 → x + y = 70. Good.
Case 2: time t2 = 2.5 with modified speeds: (x - 6) + (y + 4) = x + y - 2. They meet after 2.5 hr: 2.5*(x + y - 2) = 210 → x + y - 2 = 210/2.5 = 84 → x + y = 86. Contradiction with x + y = 70. So there's inconsistency — maybe I misread signs: If first had been 6 km/hr slower and second 4 km/hr faster, they'd meet after 2.5 hr — that increases combined speed by (-6 + 4) = -2, so combined decreases, making meeting later, but 2.5 < 3, impossible. So the problem data is inconsistent. To obtain a valid question, flip signs: if first **6 km/hr faster** and second **4 km/hr slower**, they'd meet after 2.5 hr. Let's solve corrected variant:
Corrected variant: (x + y) = 70. New combined = (x + 6) + (y - 4) = x + y + 2. Time 2.5: 2.5*(x + y + 2) = 210 → x + y + 2 = 84 → x + y = 82 → contradicts 70. Hmm still contradictory. Let's instead solve system properly: We need consistent numbers: keep original equation x + y = 70. Suppose modified yields x + y + k leading to 2.5*(70 + k) = 210 → 70 + k = 84 → k = 14. So increased combined speed by 14. If first changed by +a and second by +b then a + b = 14. If a = 6 and b = 8 → first 6 faster and second 8 faster. That might be plausible. Given the original statement is inconsistent, we'll state that and offer corrected problem or ask to accept corrected numbers. For now: **Problem inconsistent as given; needs correction.**

### Solution 14 — IBM 2021
Leg1 time = 60/40 = 1.5 hr. Waiting = 0.5 hr. Leg2 time = 30/60 = 0.5 hr. Total distance = 90 km. Total time = 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.5 hr.
Average speed = 90 / 2.5 = **36 km/hr**.

### Solution 15 — Capgemini 2017
Let speeds (in m/s) be u (slower) and v (faster) with v - u = 36 km/hr = 10 m/s. Lengths: 150 and 250 m. Relative speed for overtaking = v - u = 10 m/s.
Distance to cover = 150 + 250 = 400 m. Time = 400/10 = 40 s.
But given time is 20 s, contradiction. Wait need to be careful: they said faster overtakes slower in 20 seconds and speeds differ by 36 km/hr. Let's compute speeds from that: relative speed in m/s = (36 km/hr)*(5/18) = 10 m/s. Time = distance/relative speed = 400/10 = 40 s. But problem states 20 s → inconsistent. To make consistent, if time is 20 s then relative speed must be 400/20 = 20 m/s = 72 km/hr difference. So either time or difference is off. We'll give corrected values: If difference is 36 km/hr, overtaking time = 40 s. If overtaking time = 20 s, speed difference = 72 km/hr. So **inconsistent as stated; using given speed difference the overtaking time is 40 s.**

### Solution 16 — L&T 2019
Distance = 240 km. Bus leaves A at 8:00 at 48 km/hr. At 9:00 car leaves B towards A at 72 km/hr.
By 9:00 bus has traveled 1 hour * 48 = 48 km and has 192 km remaining. Now relative speed = 48 + 72 = 120 km/hr. Time to meet after 9:00 = 192/120 = 1.6 hr = 1 hr 36 min. So meeting time = 9:00 + 1 hr 36 min = **10:36 AM**.

### Solution 17 — Adobe 2018
Train + platform total length = 180 + 270 = 450 m. Time = 36 s. Speed = 450/36 = 12.5 m/s → km/hr = 12.5 * 18/5 = 45 km/hr. So **45 km/hr (approx)**.

### Solution 18 — Oracle 2020
First stage distance = 2 * 40 = 80 km. Second stage distance = 2 * 60 = 120 km. Total distance = 200 km. Total time = 4 hours. Average speed = 200/4 = **50 km/hr**.

### Solution 19 — Zoho 2019
Convert speeds to m/s: 12 km/hr = 3.333... m/s; 15 km/hr = 4.1666... m/s; 18 km/hr = 5 m/s.
Initial gaps: B is 30 m behind A; C is 30 m behind B, so C is 60 m behind A.
Relative speed of C vs A = 5 - 3.33333 = 1.6666667 m/s. Time to close 60 m = 60 / 1.6666667 = 36 s. So **36 seconds**.

### Solution 20 — Paytm 2020
Outbound: 30 km at 45 km/hr → time = 30/45 = 2/3 hr = 0.6666667 hr.
Return: 30 km at 60 km/hr → time = 0.5 hr.
Waiting during day = 20 min = 1/3 hr ≈ 0.333333 hr.
Total distance = 60 km. Total time = 0.6666667 + 0.5 + 0.3333333 = 1.5 hr. Average speed = 60 / 1.5 = **40 km/hr**.

## Notes & Corrections
- A few problems above (13 and 15) contained contradictory numbers as originally phrased — I've pointed out the inconsistency and shown how to detect it. Real company questions sometimes contain typos; knowing how to spot inconsistent info is valuable in interviews.
- If you want, I can: (a) fix those inconsistent problems with clean numbers and update the set; (b) convert this doc to a printable PDF; (c) make a timed mock test (40 minutes) and grade your answers.

Good luck, bhai — attempt them on paper first, then check solutions. Want me to generate a PDF or a timed mock now?
