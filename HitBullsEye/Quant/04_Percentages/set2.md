Detailed Solutions

1. Solution:

Let the original expenditure be Rs. 100.

The price of petrol increases by 25%, so the new price for the same quantity is Rs. 125.

To maintain the expenditure at Rs. 100, the reduction required is Rs. 25 on the new price of Rs. 125.

Percentage reduction = (Reduction in price / New price) \* 100

= (25 / 125) _ 100 = (1/5) _ 100 = 20%.

Answer: The car owner should reduce consumption by 20%.

2. Solution:

Let the initial income be Rs. 100.

Initial expenditure = 75% of 100 = Rs. 75.

Initial savings = Income - Expenditure = 100 - 75 = Rs. 25.

New income = 100 + 20% of 100 = Rs. 120.

New expenditure = 75 + 10% of 75 = 75 + 7.5 = Rs. 82.5.

New savings = New income - New expenditure = 120 - 82.5 = Rs. 37.5.

Increase in savings = 37.5 - 25 = Rs. 12.5.

Percentage increase in savings = (Increase in savings / Initial savings) \* 100

= (12.5 / 25) \* 100 = 50%.

Answer: His savings increased by 50%.

3. Solution:

Let the total number of voters be x.

Number of voters who cast their votes = 75% of x = 0.75x.

Number of invalid votes = 2% of 0.75x = 0.02 \* 0.75x = 0.015x.

Number of valid votes = 0.75x - 0.015x = 0.735x.

The candidate got 75% of the valid votes, which is 9261.

0.75 \* 0.735x = 9261.

0.55125x = 9261.

x = 9261 / 0.55125 = 16800.

Answer: The total number of voters was 16,800.

4. Solution:

Let the maximum marks be M.

Passing marks = 40% of M = 0.40M.

The student got 45 marks and failed by 5 marks.

So, passing marks = 45 + 5 = 50.

0.40M = 50.

M = 50 / 0.40 = 125.

Answer: The maximum marks are 125.

5. Solution:

Population after 2 years:

P_new = P \* (1 + R/100)^n

= 176400 _ (1 + 5/100)^2 = 176400 _ (1.05)^2 = 176400 \* 1.1025 = 194481.

Population 2 years ago:

P_old = P / (1 + R/100)^n

= 176400 / (1 + 5/100)^2 = 176400 / (1.05)^2 = 176400 / 1.1025 = 160000.

Answer: Population after 2 years will be 194,481 and 2 years ago it was 160,000.

6. Solution:

The key is that the amount of fruit pulp remains constant.

In 100 kg of fresh fruits, water = 68%, so pulp = 32% = 32 kg.

Let the weight of dry fruit be x kg.

In dry fruit, water = 20%, so pulp = 80%.

The pulp in dry fruit (80% of x) must be equal to the pulp from fresh fruit (32 kg).

0.80 \* x = 32.

x = 32 / 0.80 = 40 kg.

Answer: 40 kg of dry fruit can be obtained.

7. Solution:

Let the original price (Cost Price) be Rs. 100.

Marked price = 100 + 20% of 100 = Rs. 120.

Discount = 10% on marked price = 10% of 120 = Rs. 12.

Selling Price = Marked Price - Discount = 120 - 12 = Rs. 108.

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 108 - 100 = Rs. 8.

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) _ 100 = (8 / 100) _ 100 = 8%.

Answer: He gets a profit of 8%.

8. Solution:

Let the total class strength be 100.

Boys = 65, Girls = 35.

Girl students present = 80% of 35 = 0.80 \* 35 = 28.

Total students present = 70% of 100 = 70.

Boy students present = Total present - Girls present = 70 - 28 = 42.

The fraction of boys present = (Number of boys present) / (Total number of boys)

= 42 / 65.

Answer: The fraction of boys present was 42/65.

9. Solution:

Let the number be 100.

After a 20% increase, the number becomes 100 \* 1.20 = 120.

After a 20% decrease on the new number, it becomes 120 \* 0.80 = 96.

Net change = 100 - 96 = 4.

Net percentage decrease = (4 / 100) \* 100 = 4%.

Answer: There is a 4% decrease.

10. Solution:

Let the original fraction be x/y.

The numerator is increased by 200%, so new numerator = x + 200% of x = x + 2x = 3x.

The denominator is increased by 350%, so new denominator = y + 350% of y = y + 3.5y = 4.5y.

The new fraction is (3x) / (4.5y) = 5/12.

3x / 4.5y = 5/12 => x/y = (5/12) _ (4.5/3) = (5/12) _ 1.5 = 5/8.

Answer: The original fraction was 5/8.

11. Solution:

Let C's salary be Rs. 100.

B's salary is 25% of C's salary = 0.25 \* 100 = Rs. 25.

A's salary is 40% of B's salary = 0.40 \* 25 = Rs. 10.

Percentage of C's salary that is A's salary = (A's salary / C's salary) \* 100

= (10 / 100) \* 100 = 10%.

Answer: A's salary is 10% of C's salary.

12. Solution:

Original mixture weight = 60 gm.

Water in it = 75% of 60 gm = 0.75 \* 60 = 45 gm.

15 gm of water is added.

New weight of water = 45 + 15 = 60 gm.

New total weight of mixture = 60 + 15 = 75 gm.

Percentage of water in new mixture = (New weight of water / New total weight) \* 100

= (60 / 75) _ 100 = 0.8 _ 100 = 80%.

Answer: The percentage of water is 80%.

13. Solution:

Let the original rate be Rs. x per dozen.

The fall in price is 25%. New rate = x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

The amount invested is Rs. 162.

Number of dozens bought originally = 162 / x.

Number of dozens bought now = 162 / 0.75x.

According to the problem: (162 / 0.75x) - (162 / x) = 2.

162 \* (1/0.75x - 1/x) = 2.

162 \* ((1 - 0.75) / 0.75x) = 2.

162 _ (0.25 / 0.75x) = 2 => 162 _ (1/3x) = 2.

54/x = 2 => x = 27.

Answer: The original rate was Rs. 27 per dozen.

14. Solution:

Cost of first variety of rice = 26 kg \* Rs. 20/kg = Rs. 520.

Cost of second variety of rice = 30 kg \* Rs. 36/kg = Rs. 1080.

Total cost price (CP) = 520 + 1080 = Rs. 1600.

Total quantity of mixture = 26 + 30 = 56 kg.

Selling price (SP) of mixture = 56 kg \* Rs. 30/kg = Rs. 1680.

Profit = SP - CP = 1680 - 1600 = Rs. 80.

Profit percentage = (Profit / CP) _ 100 = (80 / 1600) _ 100 = 5%.

Answer: His profit percentage is 5%.

15. Solution:

Let M be the set of students who failed in Maths, and E be the set for English.

P(M) = 34%, P(E) = 42%, P(M and E) = 20%.

Percentage of students who failed in at least one subject = P(M or E) = P(M) + P(E) - P(M and E)

= 34% + 42% - 20% = 56%.

This is the percentage of students who failed in one or both subjects.

The percentage of students who passed in both subjects is 100% - 56% = 44%.

Answer: 44% of students passed in both subjects.

16. Solution:

Let the purchase price be P.

Value after 1 year = P \* (1 - 10/100) = 0.9P.

Value after 2 years = 0.9P \* 0.9 = 0.81P.

Value after 3 years (present value) = 0.81P \* 0.9 = 0.729P.

0.729P = 8748.

P = 8748 / 0.729 = 12000.

Answer: It was purchased for Rs. 12,000.

17. Solution:

Use the formula for successive percentage change: (A + B + AB/100)%.

Here, Decrease A = -20%, Increase B = +20%.

Change = (-20 + 20 + (-20 \* 20)/100)% = (0 - 400/100)% = -4%.

The negative sign indicates a decrease.

Answer: The expenditure will decrease by 4%.

18. Solution:

Let the original salary be Rs. 100.

New salary after a 25% increase = 100 \* 1.25 = Rs. 125.

To restore the original salary, the new salary must be decreased by 125 - 100 = Rs. 25.

Percentage decrease = (Decrease / New Salary) \* 100

= (25 / 125) \* 100 = 20%.

Answer: The new salary should be decreased by 20%.

19. Solution:

Let the vendor start with 100 apples.

Day 1: Sells 60% = 60 apples. Remainder = 40 apples.

Throws away 15% of the remainder = 0.15 \* 40 = 6 apples. Remainder = 40 - 6 = 34 apples.

Day 2: Sells 50% of the remainder = 0.50 \* 34 = 17 apples. Remainder = 34 - 17 = 17 apples.

Throws away the rest = 17 apples.

Total apples thrown away = 6 (Day 1) + 17 (Day 2) = 23 apples.

Percentage of apples thrown away = (23 / 100) \* 100 = 23%.

Answer: The vendor throws away 23% of his apples.

20. Solution:

Total questions = 80. Target score = 80% of 80 = 64 questions correct.

First 60 questions: Correct answers = 75% of 60 = 0.75 \* 60 = 45 questions.

Remaining questions = 80 - 60 = 20.

Required correct answers from the remaining questions = 64 - 45 = 19.

Percentage needed on the remaining 20 questions = (19 / 20) \* 100 = 95%.

Answer: She needs to answer 95% of the other questions correctly.

21. Solution:

Let B's income be Rs. 100.

A's income is 25% more, so A's income = 100 \* 1.25 = Rs. 125.

Difference in income = 125 - 100 = Rs. 25.

B's income is less than A's by (Difference / A's income) \* 100.

= (25 / 125) \* 100 = 20%.

Answer: B's income is 20% less than A's income.

22. Solution:

Let the true weight be 1000 gm.

While buying, he takes 1100 gm instead of 1000 gm (10% cheating).

While selling, he gives 900 gm instead of 1000 gm (10% cheating).

His profit is on what he sells. He sells 900 gm, but charges for 1000 gm. The cost to him for 900 gm is effectively less because he got more when he bought.

Let CP of 1 gm be Re 1. He pays Rs. 1000 but gets 1100 gm. So, his effective CP for 1100 gm is Rs. 1000.

He sells 900 gm for Rs. 1000.

CP of 900 gm = (1000 / 1100) \* 900 = Rs. 818.18.

SP of 900 gm = Rs. 1000.

Profit = 1000 - 818.18 = 181.82.

Profit % = (181.82 / 818.18) \* 100 = 22.22%.

Alternatively, using the formula (x+y+xy/100) for this specific case is not direct. A better formula is (Error% / (100 - Error%)) \* 100.

Total gain % = ((%gain_buy + %gain_sell) / (100 - %gain_sell)) \* 100 - this is also complex.

The simplest formula for this specific problem (cheating by x% on buying and selling) is: Gain % = ((100+x)^2 / 100 - 100). Wait, this is not right.

Let's use the formula for successive gain: Gain = (x + x + (x*x)/100) -> (10+10+(10*10)/100) = 21%.

Answer: The total gain is 21%.

23. Solution:

Let the third number be 100.

The first number is 20% more than 100 = 120.

The second number is 50% more than 100 = 150.

Percentage of the first number to the second = (First Number / Second Number) \* 100.

= (120 / 150) _ 100 = 0.8 _ 100 = 80%.

Answer: The first number is 80% of the second number.

24. Solution:

Let the marks in the five subjects be 10x, 9x, 8x, 7x, and 6x.

Total marks obtained = 10x + 9x + 8x + 7x + 6x = 40x.

Let the maximum marks for each subject be M. Total maximum marks = 5M.

The student's aggregate is 60%, so 40x = 60% of 5M = 0.60 \* 5M = 3M.

x = 3M / 40.

Marks in each subject:

1: 10x = 30M/40 = 0.75M or 75%

2: 9x = 27M/40 = 0.675M or 67.5%

3: 8x = 24M/40 = 0.60M or 60%

4: 7x = 21M/40 = 0.525M or 52.5%

5: 6x = 18M/40 = 0.45M or 45%

Passing marks are 50% of M (0.50M).

He passed in subjects where his score was >= 50%. This is true for the first 4 subjects.

Answer: He passed in 4 subjects.

25. Solution:

Total runs scored = 110.

Runs from boundaries (4s) = 3 \* 4 = 12.

Runs from sixes (6s) = 8 \* 6 = 48.

Total runs from boundaries and sixes = 12 + 48 = 60.

Runs made by running between the wickets = 110 - 60 = 50.

Percentage of runs by running = (50 / 110) \* 100 = 45.45%.

Answer: 45.45% of his score was made by running.

26. Solution:

Let the original price be P.

After R% increase, new price = P \* (1 + R/100).

After R% decrease on the new price, latest price = [P * (1 + R/100)] \* (1 - R/100).

Latest price = P \* (1 - (R/100)^2) = 1.

P \* (1 - R^2/10000) = 1.

P = 1 / (1 - R^2/10000) = 1 / ((10000 - R^2) / 10000) = 10000 / (10000 - R^2).

Answer: The original price was 10000 / (10000 - R^2).

27. Solution:

This is a case of compound growth. Let the height when planted be H.

Present height = H \* (1 + 20/100)^2.

540 = H _ (1.2)^2 = H _ 1.44.

H = 540 / 1.44 = 375 cm.

Answer: The height was 375 cm when planted.

28. Solution:

Let initial production be 100 units.

After 1st year (10% increase) = 100 \* 1.1 = 110.

After 2nd year (10% increase) = 110 \* 1.1 = 121.

After 3rd year (20% decrease) = 121 \* 0.8 = 96.8.

Net change = 100 - 96.8 = 3.2.

This is a decrease.

Net percentage decrease = (3.2 / 100) \* 100 = 3.2%.

Answer: There is a net decrease of 3.2% in production.

29. Solution:

Let the maximum marks be M and passing marks be P.

First candidate: 0.20M = P - 30.

Second candidate: 0.32M = P + 42.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

0.32M - 0.20M = (P + 42) - (P - 30).

0.12M = 72.

M = 72 / 0.12 = 600.

Maximum marks = 600.

Passing marks P = 0.20M + 30 = 0.20 \* 600 + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150.

Pass percentage = (Passing Marks / Maximum Marks) \* 100.

= (150 / 600) \* 100 = 25%.

Answer: The pass percentage is 25%.

30. Solution:

Let D be the set of households with a desktop and L be the set with a laptop.

P(D) = 40%, P(L) = 60%, P(D and L) = 15%.

Percentage of households with at least one device = P(D or L) = P(D) + P(L) - P(D and L).

= 40% + 60% - 15% = 85%.

Percentage of households with neither device = 100% - P(D or L).

= 100% - 85% = 15%.

Answer: 15% of households had neither device.
