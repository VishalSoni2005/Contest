# SOLUTIONS (detailed step‑by‑step)

**Notation**: percent change \(p\%\) means multiply by \(1 + p/100\) for increase and \(1 - p/100\) for decrease. Where helpful, I convert percentages to decimals.

---

### Q1 — Amazon (sample)
**Question recap:** Divide Rs 731 among A, B, C such that \(A = 25\%\) more than \(B\), and \(B = 25\%\) less than \(C\). Find \(C\).

**Solution:**
- Let \(C = x\).
- \(B = 25\%\) less than \(C\) ⇒ \(B = 0.75x\).
- \(A = 25\%\) more than \(B\) ⇒ \(A = 1.25B = 1.25 \times 0.75x = 0.9375x\).
- Sum: \(A + B + C = 0.9375x + 0.75x + x = 2.6875x = 731\).
- So \(x = 731 / 2.6875 = 272\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 272**.

### Q2 — CAT‑style (manufacturing salary)
**Question recap:** 20% employees in manufacturing. Total manufacturing salary = \(1/6\) of total company salary. Find ratio of average manufacturing salary to average non‑manufacturing salary.

**Solution:**
- Let total employees = \(N\).
- Manufacturing employees = \(0.2N\), non‑manufacturing = \(0.8N\).
- Let average salary of manufacturing be \(M\), non‑manufacturing be \(N_m\).
- Total company salary = \(0.2N \cdot M + 0.8N \cdot N_m\).
- Given \(0.2N \cdot M = \frac{1}{6}(0.2N \cdot M + 0.8N \cdot N_m)\).
- Cancel \(N\): \(0.2M = \frac{1}{6}(0.2M + 0.8N_m)\).
- Multiply by 6: \(1.2M = 0.2M + 0.8N_m\) ⇒ \(1.0M = 0.8N_m\) ⇒ \(M/N_m = 0.8\).
- Ratio \(M:N_m = 4:5\).

**Answer:** \(4:5\). citeturn0search10turn0search3

### Q3 — Mark‑up m% then 20% discount, leaves 10% profit
**Question recap:** Find \(m\) if \((1+m\%)\) marked up, then 20% discount, resulting in 10% profit.

**Solution:**
- Let cost = \(C\).
- Marked price \(= C(1 + m/100)\).
- After 20% discount: selling price \(= C(1+m/100)\times 0.8\).
- Given this equals \(1.10C\) (10% profit): \((1+m/100) \times 0.8 = 1.10\).
- So \(1+m/100 = 1.10/0.8 = 1.375\).
- Hence \(m/100 = 0.375\) ⇒ \(m = 37.5\%\).

**Answer:** **37.5%**.

---

### Q4 — +20% then −25%
**Solution:**
- Multiply factors: \(1.20 \times 0.75 = 0.90\) ⇒ net factor 0.9 ⇒ **10% decrease**.

**Answer:** Net **−10%**.

---

### Q5 — 10% then 20% raise (successive)
**Solution:**
- Multiply factors: \(1.10 \times 1.20 = 1.32\) ⇒ net factor 1.32 ⇒ **32% increase**.

**Answer:** **32%**.

---

### Q6 — 8% annually for 3 years
**Solution:**
- Compound factor: \(1.08^3\).
- Percent increase \(= (1.08^3 - 1)\times 100\).
- \(1.08^3 = 1.259712\ldots\) ⇒ increase ≈ \(25.9712\%\).
- Rounded to 2 decimals: **25.97%**.

**Answer:** **25.97% (approx.)**.

---

### Q7 — Weighted target achievement
**Solution:**
- Total employees = 40 + 60 = 100 (convenient).
- Total achieved = \(40 \times 75\% + 60 \times 85\% = 3000 + 5100 = 8100\) percentage‑points.
- Overall percentage = \(8100 / 100 = 81\%\).

**Answer:** **81% overall**.

---

### Q8 — Weighted exam percentage required
**Question recap:** weights 40%, 35%, 25% with scores 60, 75, and unknown \(p\). Overall \(=70\).

**Solution:**
- Equation: \(0.4\times60 + 0.35\times75 + 0.25\times p = 70\).
- Compute left known part: \(24 + 26.25 = 50.25\).
- So \(0.25p = 70 - 50.25 = 19.75\) ⇒ \(p = 19.75/0.25 = 79\).

**Answer:** Must score **79%** in Exam‑3.

---

### Q9 — Two successive discounts (10% & 20%), final Rs. 720
**Solution:**
- Net multiplier = \(0.9 \times 0.8 = 0.72\).
- Original price \(= 720 / 0.72 = 1000\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 1000**.

---

### Q10 — CP from loss/profit difference
**Solution:**
- Let CP = \(C\).
- Selling at 10% loss ⇒ SP1 = \(0.9C\).
- Selling at 20% profit ⇒ SP2 = \(1.2C\).
- Given SP2 − SP1 = 180 ⇒ \(1.2C - 0.9C = 0.3C = 180\).
- \(C = 180 / 0.3 = 600\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 600**.

---

### Q11 — Alloy mixing for 70% gold
**Solution (alligation):**
- Let ratio X:Y = \((70 - 60):(80 - 70) = 10:10 = 1:1\).
- (Using differences between target and component percentages.)

**Answer:** Mix **X:Y = 1:1**.

*Note:* This is a classic alligation result (Capgemini‑style practice). citeturn0search13turn0search6

---

### Q12 — Increase 25% then decrease to original — required decrease?
**Solution:**
- After +25% price becomes \(1.25P\). We need a factor \(1-d\) so that \(1.25(1-d) = 1\).
- \(1-d = 1/1.25 = 0.8\) ⇒ \(d = 0.20 = 20\%\).

**Answer:** **20%** decrease.

---

### Q13 — Marked 40% above CP, 30% discount, then 10% extra off
**Solution:**
- CP = \(C\). MP = \(1.40C\).
- After 30% discount: price \(= 1.40C \times 0.70 = 0.98C\).
- After additional 10% off: \(0.98C \times 0.90 = 0.882C\).
- SP = \(0.882C\) ⇒ net change = \(0.882 - 1 = -0.118 = -11.8\%\).

**Answer:** **Loss of 11.8%**.

---

### Q14 — Solve for x where +x% then −(x−10)% gives net +8%
**Solution:**
- Net multiplier = \(\left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right)\left(1 - \frac{x-10}{100}\right) = 1.08\).
- Let \(u = x/100\). Expression: \((1+u)(1 - (u - 0.10)) = 1.08\).
- Expand and solve (quadratic). Solving gives \(x = -10\) or \(x = 20\).
- Negative increase (−10%) is extraneous here; take positive solution: **x = 20**.

**Check:** \(1.20\times(1 - 0.10)=1.20\times0.90=1.08\). Correct.

**Answer:** **20%**.

---

### Q15 — Mixture: make 40L of 18% from 25% & 10%
**Solution (alligation):**
- Ratio of (25%) : (10%) = (18 − 10) : (25 − 18) = 8 : 7.
- Total parts = 15. For 40 L:
  - 25% solution = \(40 \times 8/15 = 21\frac{1}{3}\) L \(= 21.333\ldots\) L.
  - 10% solution = \(40 \times 7/15 = 18\frac{2}{3}\) L \(= 18.666\ldots\) L.

**Answer:** **21.333... L of 25%** + **18.666... L of 10%** (or **64/3 L** and **56/3 L**).

(Variant CAT‑style mixture problem.) citeturn0search3

---

### Q16 — 40% → 48%: percent increase and percentage points
**Solution:**
- Absolute change = \(48 - 40 = 8\) percentage points.
- Percent increase relative to original = \(8 / 40 \times 100 = 20\%\).

**Answer:** **20% increase** (which is an **8 percentage‑point** rise).

---

### Q17 — Discount 30% then tax 12% on discounted price
**Solution:**
- Discounted price = \(1500 \times 0.70 = 1050\).
- After 12% tax: \(1050 \times 1.12 = 1176\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 1176**.

---

### Q18 — 30% part up 50%, 70% part down 20% → overall change
**Solution:**
- New value fraction = \(0.3\times1.5 + 0.7\times0.8 = 0.45 + 0.56 = 1.01\) of original.
- Overall change = \(+0.01 = +1\%\).

**Answer:** **Increase of 1%**.

---

### Q19 — Replace 10% mixture with pure milk; water goes from 10% → ?
**Solution (take 100 L for convenience):**
- Initially: water = 10 L, milk = 90 L.
- Remove 10% of mixture → remove 10 L (water 10% of that = 1 L water removed).
- Remaining water = 9 L, remaining milk = 81 L.
- Add 10 L pure milk → milk becomes 91 L, water remains 9 L.
- New water % = \(9/100 = 9\%\).

**Answer:** **9%** water.

---

### Q20 — 40% then extra 10% off (on discounted price)
**Solution:**
- First discount → \(2000 \times 0.60 = 1200\).
- Extra 10% off → \(1200 \times 0.90 = 1080\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 1080**.

---

### Q21 — Side +10% ⇒ area change
**Solution:**
- New area factor = \(1.10^2 = 1.21\).
- Area increased by \(21\%\).

**Answer:** **21%**.

---

### Q22 — Combined growth 15% and 20%
**Solution:**
- Combined factor = \(1.15 \times 1.20 = 1.38\).
- Equivalent single increase = \(1.38 - 1 = 0.38 = 38\%\).

**Answer:** **38%**.

---

### Q23 — Investments A = 20% more than B, C = 25% less than A; total Rs. 1,45,000
**Solution:**
- Let \(B = x\). Then \(A = 1.2x\). \(C = 0.75A = 0.75\times1.2x = 0.9x\).
- Total \(= 1.2x + x + 0.9x = 3.1x = 145000\).
- \(x = 145000 / 3.1 = 46774.193548\) (approx).
- So:
  - \(B \approx Rs. \;46,774.19\)
  - \(A = 1.2x \approx Rs. \;56,129.03\)
  - \(C = 0.9x \approx Rs. \;42,096.77\)

Alternatively present as ratio \(A:B:C = 12:10:9\) (sum 31 parts). Each part = \(145000/31 \approx 4677.41935\); multiply to get amounts above.

**Answer (approx):**  
\(A \approx Rs. 56,129.03,\; B \approx Rs. 46,774.19,\; C \approx Rs. 42,096.77.\)

---

### Q24 — Profit = 25% **of selling price**
**Explanation & solution:**
- Let SP = \(S\). Profit = \(0.25S\).
- But profit = \(S - CP\). So \(S - CP = 0.25S\) ⇒ \(0.75S = CP\).
- Given \(CP = 600\) ⇒ \(S = 600 / 0.75 = 800\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 800 (SP)**.  
(Profit relative to CP = \((800 - 600)/600 = 200/600 = 33.333\%\) as a check.)

---

### Q25 — Women now: 30% baseline, +20% growth in female headcount only
**Solution (take 100 employees):**
- Initially women = 30, men = 70.
- Women increase 20% ⇒ new women = 36.
- Men remain 70 ⇒ total = 106.
- New women% = \(36/106 \approx 33.9623\%\).

**Answer:** **≈ 33.96%** women.

---

### Q26 — Mark‑up 50%, then 20% discount; claim 10% profit?
**Logic & solution:**
- Let CP = \(C\). MP = \(1.5C\).
- After 20% discount: SP = \(1.5C \times 0.8 = 1.2C\).
- Profit% relative to CP = \((1.2C - C)/C = 20\%\).
- The profit is **fixed at 20%** regardless of CP. So claiming 10% profit after those two fixed multipliers is **not possible**.

**Answer:** **Impossible** — the sequence yields **20% profit** always, not 10%.

---

### Q27 — Equivalent continuous rate for 8% annual compound
**Solution:**
- Solve \(e^{r_c} = 1.08\) ⇒ \(r_c = \ln(1.08)\).
- Numerically \(r_c \approx 0.07696104113612839 = 7.696\%\) (approx).
- Rounded to 3 decimals: **7.696%**.

**Answer:** **≈ 7.696% (continuous)**.

---

### Q28 — Passed at least one
**Solution:**
- Passed at least one = passed only Math + passed only Physics + passed both = \(25\% + 30\% + 10\% = 65\%\).

**Answer:** **65%**.

---

### Q29 — 15% discount then 18% GST
**Solution:**
- After 15% discount: \(50000 \times 0.85 = 42500\).
- After 18% GST: \(42500 \times 1.18 = 50150\).

**Answer:** **Rs. 50,150**.

---

### Q30 — Decrease 12% then increase 15%: net change?
**Solution:**
- Net factor = \(0.88 \times 1.15 = 1.012\).
- Net change = \(+1.2\%\) approximately.

**Answer:** **Population higher by 1.2%** than original.
