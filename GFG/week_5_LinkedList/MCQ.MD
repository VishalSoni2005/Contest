# Linked List MCQs with Explanations

---

### 1. In cycle detection, why does the fast pointer move 2 steps while slow moves 1 step?

- ✅ **Answer:** All of the above
- **Explanation:** The fast pointer ensures they meet if a cycle exists, reduces time complexity, and covers more nodes.

---

### 2. What is the major disadvantage of linked lists compared to arrays?

- ✅ **Answer:** Wasted memory due to pointers
- **Explanation:** Each node stores extra pointer(s), leading to memory overhead compared to arrays.

### 3. In a circular linked list, how do you efficiently insert at the end if you only have the head pointer?

- ✅ **Answer:** O(n)
- **Explanation:** Without a tail pointer, you must traverse the list to find the last node, making insertion O(n).
